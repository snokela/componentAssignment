## Project Overview 
This project is part of my Dynamic Web Page course and consists of three main assignments:

### 1. Product Page (Component-Based)
The first assignment is to create a product page using React, which includes:

- Header Component: A reusable header with an image and title passed as props.
- Product Form Component: A product selection form with a dropdown for products and buttons for quantity adjustment. It includes a check to prevent negative quantities.
- Order Info Component: Displays the product name, price, and quantity with a calculated total price based on the selected quantity. Components are styled with CSS (not inline).

### 2. Simple Website with API Integration
The second assignment involves creating a website that retrieves data from an external API. I selected an API that displays a random dog image on page load. The website includes a button that fetches a new image and displays the dog breed extracted from the image URL, adding interactivity to the page.

### 3. Version Control 
The third assignment focuses on version control, which includes:

- Regular commits and descriptive commit messages.
- Branching to organize the work.
- Pull request or merge process for combining branches.
